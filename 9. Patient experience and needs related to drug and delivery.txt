### Patient experience and needs related to drug and delivery ###

Keep working with the doctors. I think a lot of the issues in the medical community is that it is still kind of an unknown disease. Especially in those smaller centers, where maybe the doctor has never seen this. I run everything through my GP first. So, once he found out that I have this, he did not know about it. And he told me, I have never had a patient like this before. I am going to learn all about this. And he spent the time learning. He learned on the journey with me, so that is pretty cool of my doctor. I believe it is important that healthcare professionals are honest with patients and families about the risks, so they can base their decisions on the facts. The support my father got was very good, especially from the specialist nurse who helped him to manage his condition. I have a good relationship with both the nurse and the respiratory therapist. They will decide on a plan, and then the nurse communicates with [the ILD physician] or [the rehabilitation/palliative respiratory care physician]. They handle all of that really well. We [patient and the nurse] had a conversation around this ... about how well our relationship is working. And I trust her [the nurse] implicitly to be communicative with [the ILD physician and the rehabilitation/ palliative respiratory care physician]. You have full involvement and knowledge in what is going on. It is very clear to us she is [the ILD physician] going to see us through to the end of this and it is her primary concern to do the best for us that she can. And that is a very good feeling—a feeling of trust and security. We are just feeling very lucky to have somebody like her and her entire group because they all have that same approach or philosophy to it all. We were terrified to have those conversations but once we knew for sure that was what was happening, we made it a point to talk about it openly and talk about her fears and concerns and that was huge. That was one thing that Dr. J nailed was being up front. What do you want your death to look like? How do you want to die? What scares you the most about it? And for my mom it was—she did not want to be drugged. She wanted to be conscious right until she could not be anymore so they kept that in mind. Do I just go into hospital and I just gasp until I die? But, being reassured by them that I can have a home death, there can be drugs that can help to calm me down, and people there ... Yes. And how caring and supportive the doctors can be. That there are drugs, medications that they can give you to calm you down, so it is not scary at the end. I ended up in hospital for a week on IV antibiotics and a chest tube. Plus they produced a Green Sleeve, which I would never seen or heard about until then. I can see their point. They want to get it done before you end up needing resuscitation. But honest to god if your are short of breath, got pains in your side and feeling lousy, it is not necessarily the time to be asking you questions about levels of care. And where you want to die and what the different types of experiences look like—so dying in a hospital versus a hospice versus at home. And with each of those different scenarios— the positives and negatives about it ... So it is really just about having those conversations and so people know what to expect and they are not blind-sided by it and making sure that the hospice is willing to work with them. And if they are going to stay at home, what resources are available to them? I think everything should be addressed … There is so many facets to a terminal disease that you do not even think about before your are diagnosed ... It is really hard ... By being honest. By laying it on the line and telling me this is what we do. This is what we can do. This is what could happen ... It is very important. It is one of my biggest fears. But now that I know a bit more about it, I go to a support group that Dr. J spoke about ... and I do feel much better just knowing. I was afraid of the end. Of how violent it could be. From things that I have heard … it was very calm and very reassuring. My hope is that oxygen companies will realize that oxygen needs are not a one size fits all across patients and will work more closely and compassionately with patients to ensure their oxygen needs can be met in a way that allows as much quality of life and as little frustration as possible. I know that since my transplant there has been great strides with new drugs to slow down the progression of IPF and research continues to find a cure. I only hope and pray that this will be made possible soon so the need for transplantation will lessen. There was a general lack of understanding of the condition is progression by GPs and others, and no services available to support patients and their families at the end of life. In my view, the health system let my mother, and us as a family, down badly at the end of her life, due to disjointed services, breakdowns in communication, and the fact that there was no one person to coordinate health and care services. It was truly a traumatic experience. I do feel that unlike cancer patients, pulmonary fibrosis sufferers do not receive the same emotional and mental support to help prepare them through the journey ... Explaining pulmonary fibrosis to anyone was a challenge… This really needs to change as it is deeply unfair and seems borderline discriminatory. Anyone going through pulmonary fibrosis needs to be supported and understood, just like any other terminal illness. Getting any support for mum was hard because it felt like her condition was not taken seriously until it became dire. My father died of pulmonary fibrosis when I was in college, and that was more than twenty years ago. In all those years, there is been no change in a patient is experience with the disease.
