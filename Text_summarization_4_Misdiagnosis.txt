# Example usage - Misdiagnosis
text = '''My dad was misdiagnosed for five years and was finally told he had IPF one week before he died. I changed respirologists part way through (the process of being treated) because I wasn’t getting the information I wanted. Doctor (diagnoses) with fibermyalgia [sic] and prescribed prednisone 40mg… My arthritis results came back negative… Upon visiting a physician he noticed that my oxygen is very very low… had CT scan with contrast of my entire chest where they discovered fibrosis. I was first diagnosed with bronchiectasis in 2002. It took till 2011 before I discovered that I had pulmonary fibrosis. I got a really bad respiratory flu. I didn’t recover in 10 or 12 days… and at first they thought it was COPD. My health had been deteriorating for quite a while running up to my IPF diagnosis in 2015. In early 2014, I had been experiencing severe chest pains. An x-ray revealed honeycombing on my lungs and my doctor could hear crackling. Following a lung biopsy at hospital, my partner and I were initially told that I did not have IPF – we left the hospital feeling relieved. Unfortunately, the relief was short-lived. At my next routine appointment, another doctor informed me that I did have IPF. This came as a massive shock and I left the hospital feeling unhappy and anxious about the future. When I got home, I told Allison, who was distraught; having previously read that the average life expectancy from diagnosis was 3-5 years. Very shocked. Really upset at the time. Coming to terms with it slowly. They gave me a booklet and I wish I didn’t read it. To give it to someone as soon as they diagnosed it, I think it was not a good idea. While the diagnosis itself might be clearly explained at the time, patients report a subsequent lack of support and information: After diagnosis, I have been left on my own to cope, with no help from anyone. Things were very confusing at this time for me, and I remember wondering why I was being admitted, because I didn’t feel particularly worse than I had in the months prior. I felt desperate and alone. After such an awful diagnosis, my next appointment was in 6 months and nothing in between. To be diagnosed with IPF is absolutely devastating ... You are told you have three to five years to live ... It’s a very, very scary proposition. I guess the reason why I felt so surprised was that there was no mention of pulmonary fibrosis in the years prior, when I had multiple episodes of flu, bronchitis, pneumonia. It was a bit of a shock to the system ... we thought it was just a chest infection ... he had a little cough but nothing too much. Initially it was a huge shock to discover that he had IPF, which I had never heard of. Given that I am a life-long non-smoker and never knowingly worked in a hazardous environment, I couldn’t fathom my diagnosis. Why me and IPF? I feel picked on, I feel I haven’t smoked for all these years, I don’t drink, I’m not overly fat, why is this happening to me? My general practitioner had no idea what was wrong with me. I used to feel upset when I left his office as I knew he did not believe what I was telling him. I was diagnosed with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) caused by scleroderma at the end of October in 2012… My first reaction was disbelief especially when I was told that one of the ‘treatments’ would be chemotherapy. Blood tests, CT scans and a lung biopsy eventually confirmed a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis in 2011. My family and I later found out that rheumatoid arthritis caused my pulmonary fibrosis. I was shocked, but I was determined to see the bright side of things. We had a diagnosis and now could start on a path of monitoring this to hopefully prevent any further complications. At the time of diagnosis I had no symptoms, I was athletic and completely healthy. I had no idea the impact it would come to have on my life. I was told I had Interstitial Lung Disease and Pneumonitis which resulted in scarring and a partially collapsed left lung in early 2019 when I had been on MTX. Is that pulmonary fibrosis? I don’t know. I’m about to be referred to a Respiratory consultant (again) as I have a blood clot in each lung and so will ask for an explanation of all the different terms. … but had always been diagnosed as something else, such as pneumonia. This unfortunately led to countless, useless prescriptions of antibiotics; to post-nasal drip; to possibly tuberculosis (simple tests proved otherwise). Luckily, my new and astute physician decided that the problem was greater and a referral to a respirologist confirmed IPF. I was referred to a respirologist and put on a high dose steroid, and a bronchodilator inhaler. Several tests followed and finally in December 2010, based on a lung biopsy, I was diagnosed with IPF that had already reduced my lung function by 40%. Have [sic] been diagnosed this by my respiratory consultant due to decrease in my lung function tests. I was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis approx 5 years ago. My respiratory consultant believes it RA related and I’ve no reason to doubt him as I’m as sure as I can be that my lungs were damaged during a prolonged RA flare. Am going to a connective tissue consultant… as my rheumatologist consultant thinks this would help me better. My hospital has a scleroderma specialist, thankfully! I had been treated for pulmonary fibrosis there. Some other issues landed me with rheumatology, but they seem to have a few multidisciplinary specidiaagalists that see scleroderma patients, which is great.'''
