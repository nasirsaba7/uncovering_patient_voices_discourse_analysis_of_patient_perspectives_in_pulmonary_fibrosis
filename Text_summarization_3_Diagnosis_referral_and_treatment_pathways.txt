I started experiencing a buildup of mucus in my throat causing a constant clearing and coughing. The colour was always clear so, since both my family doctor and I felt it was post nasal drip, I was prescribed nasal sprays. Before my diagnosis I’d been feeling some pain on my lower back that wouldn’t go away. I also noticed that I often needed to cough to clear my throat before having a conversation but I wouldn’t call it severe. It took around 2 weeks for her to be diagnosed after being taken to A&E at Hammersmith Hospital, London when she felt her breathing was not right. I remember being told at the time that her lungs were too weak for a biopsy to be done to confirm her diagnosis. Shortly after, she was given a prognosis of 5 years. This was a massive shock and we felt totally winded. It was unexplainable for us and felt surreal. I first mentioned my cough to my GP at my annual health check in 2013. The X-ray came back clear. But a year later, another X-ray showed something on my left lung. Lots of tests were inconclusive, but finally the results of a surgical lung biopsy indicated I had IPF. It took 2 years of back and forth to get to this stage! Then we moved and I saw a new GP. I was sent for a CT scan almost immediately, which showed that there was damage in my airways. I was told I had pulmonary fibrosis and referred to hospital. After a lung biopsy and further tests I was finally diagnosed, three years after my first visit to the GP. At the age of 4, I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis… we counted ourselves lucky that it appeared I had the presentation where it attacks primarily the joints. We didn’t realize this would later take our journey down another path… My childhood had its aches and pains. After college was when things really started to change. I was diagnosed with double pneumonia shortly after graduating… Blood tests, CT scans and a lung biopsy eventually confirmed a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis in 2011. My family and I later found out that rheumatoid arthritis caused my pulmonary fibrosis. I was diagnosed with double pneumonia shortly after graduating. After recovering, I still had a cough that I couldn’t shake no matter how many over-the-counter or prescription dedications I tried, and while I was far from an athlete before, the shortness of breath was slightly more noticeable now. At first I was told I had arthritis, then rheumatoid arthritis. Lupus was also diagnosed and I was given treatments for them all. Nothing helped and I only got worse ... he ran a myriad of tests; X- rays, blood and urine ... and told us that I had scleroderma with CREST and pulmonary fibrosis. My breathing complications became really bad so my chest specialist thought that I had a condition called bronchiectasis and did [an] MRI scan to detect it. This came back clear of bronchiectasis but he said we did find pulmonary fibrosis on the scan.'''
