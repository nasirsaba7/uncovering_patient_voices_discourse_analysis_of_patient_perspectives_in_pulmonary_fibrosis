### Patient experiences and needs related to evidence/translation ###

I hope my participation in the [Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation] Registry can ultimately help other patients understand and plan for what their disease may bring. How do you learn to live a fairly productive life when you have a progressive disease and there is no playbook on what to expect? By filling out quality-of-life questionnaires for the Registry, I want to provide enough data points so that healthcare providers can help their patients work through their struggles. Nevertheless, questions remained, and one of them was worrisome enough to get people to consider an unconventional approach to follow-up research. The problem is that the results that come out of drug studies in mice almost never translate to humans… As a result, we have close to thirty failed drug trials in pulmonary fibrosis alone. I take part in every research study I can… Maybe that information will not help me, but it may help someone else, maybe my children or grandchildren. Now for the pulmonologist, the breathing is that big target because it’s a measurable thing, but for me the improvement, the quality of life is, can I walk upstairs better, can I perform things better, can I take a shower and put on clothes at the same time within the same hour? Those are things that are important to me. I struggle with the pulmonary function tests just as my illness progresses the pulmonary function tests become more and more challenging … It would be great if … somebody could ... come up with a better … a different PFT. [In relation to caregiver assessments and caregiver reported outcomes] Sometimes the caregiver really knows … living with someone, I think you have a better perspective. And I think it’d be valuable for you to get the caregiver’s opinion … because they’re with them all the time. But before you start (pulmonary function tests), just say Jim, Mary, Tom, we have no idea where you’re at. Just give us your best shot. You know what I mean? A little bit of a pep talk probably would not hurt.
