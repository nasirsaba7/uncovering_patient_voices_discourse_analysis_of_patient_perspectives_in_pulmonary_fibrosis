### Specific impacts of PF on activities of daily living including navigating healthcare environment and access ###

As IPF was destroying my dad’s life, he struggled with the disappointment that no cure existed, and he looked for a way to support research that could lead to a cure. I just wish it would stop. The feeling that it is never going to improve is sometimes overwhelming. I used to play a lot of golf, swimming, cricket, you name it. I have had no problem, but now I am a television viewer. I have sometimes found lifting whatever across the garden these days is difficult, but before it was easy. I try to keep everything in precise order, so things at the same place all the time. It’s sort of reorganizing your life, try and do everything in one place before you move to another. There are occasions when I can not participate in events because I am too fatigued and I have learned that it is important to pay attention to my body when it is telling me to rest ... I am determined not to let this disease steal my life… … The pain and distressing fatigue made it difficult to exercise, as well, which led to decreased function and more weight gain. I felt trapped in a distressing cycle of illness ... The damage to my lungs from the sarcoidosis has left me with many limitations but I try not to allow these limitations to stop me from living my best life. I work full- time, I travel, I exercise and interact with my friends and family. I am on oxygen all the time, and can only walk a short distance. Because my left lung collapsed due to so much scar tissue, I have partially lost my voice. I limit my physical activities, take measures to keep my hands and feet warm at all times, avoid unnecessary physical contact with people, and avoid eating out. I also try to limit my travel. When I was first diagnosed [with IPF], we made significant lifestyle changes, we downsized our house in preparation and immediately booked all the holidays we could. I now only work part time, which enables me to work around the many hospital appointments. Allison accompanies me on most appointments for moral support and to listen to the details. Under occupational health advice, Charlie’s employer has altered his role so he is office based now and has reduced working hours. I find it very frustrating that I cannot do the amount of manual tasks I used to do and quite often have to leave jobs unfinished for another time. Jobs I would previously do without thinking now have to be planned and timed. Some tasks I just can not do at all anymore which goes against a lifetime of independence. Daily routines like taking a shower, brushing my teeth, or getting dressed are a full time job. As the disease progressed, it became more exhausting. I couldn’t do anything without oxygen. Everything I try to do, which would usually take a day to do, takes me several days instead. I started to notice the effects of the disease and how difficult very simple tasks such as brushing my teeth, taking a shower, putting on clothes, chronic coughing with clear mucus, walking, and climbing stairs or inclines had become. I get breathless doing everyday things like making a cup of tea. It can be quite isolating, but you’ve got to keep going and learn how to adapt to your new norm. Sheetal became breathless when on a long walk or climbing stairs, but she was able to continue working, do the shopping, daily chores and look after Naisha. She wanted to live and be there for Naisha and was able to live a fairly normal life with her symptoms. She was a very strong and courageous person, in fact, the bravest woman I have known. Nothing phased her. But it must have been incredibly difficult for her living in the knowledge that she had limited time– particularly as a mother who wanted to be there to see her daughter grow up. You effectively become disabled in your own house. You need care. You need to have somebody to help you with simple tasks like washing and dressing. My breathing became laboured and simply walking exhausted me — stairs, hills and steep grades were killers. Basic chores involving any form of exertion not only slowed my ability to do things but my desire to do them. I am on oxygen 24/7 but I still struggle with day-to-day activities. Initially, you notice it because you find, you know, walking up hills difficult… then over time even walking up the stairs ... slowly it becomes difficult even to walk on the flat. My activities are severely limited now. Going and taking in my recycling bin requires supplementary oxygen. I can not get out to get the paper every day, so I read the paper every morning, virtually. I took time off from work and worked from home on many occasions. I began to feel isolated and ostracized because of the cough. I was embarrassed by the shortness of breath. I was irritable and suffered from insomnia because of the Prednisone that I was on to control my symptoms, and I was depressed about the weight it caused me to gain. Well, if you can not breathe, you can not do anything. And at this point of the journey, that’s about where I am. I can do no housework, I can not even wash my hair. I have to plan everything that I am going to do that’s going to take energy. I had scarring after severe ARDS – it is nickname is concrete lung – the lung becomes so rigid. The medical staff presumed I would lose a great deal of lung capacity. After some brilliant hospital physiotherapy, a year after ICU, my lungs were fairly normal. Unfortunately a pleural effusion of my left lung through having my leukaemia colonise this area, has left me slightly breathless but that was 2yrs later. I am on hospice care now and have found it to be so helpful and encouraging. I am 77, but mostly enjoy life. We adapted to a slower pace of life. Changes were made to our home to make it easier for us both to move around. We got used to a different social life, as I was unable to leave Peter for more than 2 hours at a time. I try not to do things that trigger my cough, which is everything. I am embarrassed with other people’s reactions as they do not understand my condition. [In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic] all that year, I had been pulling away from social interaction… So when March 2020 came along it was like more of the same. … I am trying to fill my time and concentrate on something else worthwhile, the rugby club and the APF charity fit the bill! We’ve also become involved with the APF support group which is great for connecting with and helping others. Because who wants to go out, first thing they think is that I am contagious, and I am coughing all over the place [… ] the first thing people think is why can not she do something about that cough? ... But they do not understand what the problem is, why I can not stop coughing, and it does, you know, I am not going to say I get embarrassed by it, but I do not want anybody to feel [un]comfortable [… ] You know, like recently there was something, my granddaughter received an award, and I couldn’t go. So I just made the choice not to go. But it has impacted my life. I man, I am pretty much home bound. Sue became ill in her early fifties with pulmonary fibrosis. Very quickly life changed for us. We’ve been together since we were teenagers. We were devastated when we received the diagnosis of IPF. I am always reminding myself that Sue used to be able to do everything and now she can not I have to be an extension of her. She still has the same strong opinions, emotions and aspirations. I have learnt to be more patient, tolerant and understanding. Caring simply means you just help them achieve whatever it is they want to do. Being a carer for your partner pulls on the heart strings and tests all the bonds you have relied on throughout your life together. I feel empowered by understanding the disease and treatments. For me and my wife the two most difficult parts of living with scleroderma are 1) the sense of uncertainty and 2) the coordination of care among the many doctors and facilities involved. The sense of uncertainty makes us fearful of the real and imaginary symptoms that we see in me. I got told off by my daughter for cutting the grass. But I got to do it. I got to do it when I get the chance. My daughter knows, my husband knows. He has been very protective in a loving way. My son, haven’t told him. My son had a shock when he saw me with the oxygen. Eventually she is talking about us moving downstairs and staying downstairs once it gets to a certain point—well I do not want that. I’d rather take 10 minutes to go upstairs to go to bed than staying downstairs all the time. What consumes my husband controls my life as well. It soon became about logistics and practicalities and how our home would need to be adapted with a bedroom downstairs and wider door frames and ramps for wheel chair access. At the time, we didn’t feel the full force of what this meant. It was scary to think that my dad had only possibly 5 years to live, but because he hadn’t changed much (apart from a consistent cough), the terminal diagnosis hadn’t quite hit home ... His use of oxygen tanks was a big adjustment at first, and at times was difficult to see. But we knew he needed it to continue being as active as possible. Pulmonary fibrosis has hit my family hard, but the magnitude and impact on families grows exponentially when you multiply that by as many as 500,000 deaths every decade in the US alone. I have had some truly frightening experiences where coughing has caused my throat to close and, for a few seconds, I can not inhale or exhale. This lasts only a few seconds but it is terrifying for my family. It affects your whole family ... our children, our extended friends, everybody’s lives were tinged by the illness that I was going through. I have tried to talk about this (end of life care) with my wife, but she interrupted me suddenly; she does not even want to hear me talk. In Spain it is necessary to improve early diagnosis of IPF. It is also necessary to create specific Multidisciplinary Centers that would allow an adequate follow-up and treatment to those suffering from the disease. As there is no national transplant waiting list, it is not guaranteed that the person who needs the transplant most will get an available organ first. One of his biggest fears is that he will miss the ‘window of opportunity’ to go on the waiting list. If his health declines too much, he might no longer be suitable: he needs to be sick enough to need a transplant, but not too sick to prevent the transplant going ahead. Most oxygen providers will provide a home concentrator and either tanks or a portable oxygen concentrator (POC). Initially I ended up purchasing a POC out of pocket because it was difficult to get through insurance. Tanks are very heavy and, depending on your flow rate, you may have to carry more than one tank with you. Last fall I was prescribed a POC with a low continuous flow capability and it took over two months, and several follow-up calls by me… oxygen deliveries can be unreliable and sometimes require that you be home for a full day. I wanna know how I am doing you know, I want to be able to see this is what it was last time I did the test and this is what it is now. I have got every reading I have ever done for the last 3 or 4 years. So, when my boy graphed it on the computer so we can see exactly where I am at, how I am going, you know whether my gas transfer is going up or down, do that type of thing. And within say right, maybe I gotta do a bit more exercise or whatever else, it is a terrific gauge. I sort of keep my phone, does the counting actually, number of steps and kilometres walked so, that’s a rough guide to how much I have done. Sometimes the caregiver really knows … living with someone, I think you have a better perspective. And I think it’d be valuable for you to get the caregiver’s opinion … because they’re with them all the time.
