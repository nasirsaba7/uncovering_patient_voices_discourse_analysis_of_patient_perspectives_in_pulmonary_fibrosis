### living with PF: patient population ###
I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, also known as IPF. I was only 28 years old.
IPF has been a surprise and a life-altering challenge. I’m nearly 71 years old, and was formally diagnosed three years ago.
At the age of 4, I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis… we counted ourselves lucky that it appeared I had the presentation where it attacks primarily the joints. We didn’t realize this would later take our journey down another path… My childhood had its aches and pains. After college was when things really started to change. I was diagnosed with double pneumonia shortly after graduating… Blood tests, CT scans and a lung biopsy eventually confirmed a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis in 2011. My family and I later found out that rheumatoid arthritis caused my pulmonary fibrosis.
